    /// the end epoch the vesting happens in a linear manner beginning from the specified amount to be unlocked at cliff
    /// and ending with the final amount.

    /// There are two main parties in the vesting blueprint:
    /// * An Admin: The admin is any party which has the `admin_badge`, typically this would be the instantiator of the
    /// component but it does not have to be. The admin pays the tokens and and sets the vesting schedule (or has that
    /// done on their behalf) and has the right to terminate the vesting of tokens at any period if they so choose to.
    /// * A Beneficiary: Any party which has a valid vesting schedule non-fungible token provided by the vesting
    /// component. The vesting schedule provides the beneficiaries with the right to withdraw their tokens from the
    /// vesting component, authenticates them, and keeps track of the important information used to track their amount
    /// of vested tokens .The vesting blueprint allows for the existence of multiple beneficiaries enrolled in the same
    /// component.
    ///
    /// The termination of the vesting of tokens at any point of time without prior notice can be of worry especially
    /// to people waiting for their funds to vest. Therefore, the vesting blueprint allows for the admin to give up
    /// their termination rights which may be needed in some cases. In a vesting component with multiple admins, the 
    /// majority of the admins are required to agree to agree to the giving up of termination rights before they're 
    /// given up.
